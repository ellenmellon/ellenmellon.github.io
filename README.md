### About Me

I am a second-year CS master student in [UIUC Data Mining Research Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/), supervised by [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). My research interest falls into areas of data mining, machine learning and natural language processing, focusing on turning massive unstructured text corpora into structured factual knowledge for better exploration and analysis of large corpora. I am currently working on tasks of information extraction and taxonomy construction from text corpus. Please see my recent publications for details. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, with minors in Computer Science, Math and Business. I was very fortunate to have [J. Gary Eden](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jgeden) as my academic (and life) mentor throughout the four years. I have been working on image processing projects in [MRI lab](http://mri.beckman.uiuc.edu/) at UIUC during my sophomore year, supervised by [Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/z-liang).
