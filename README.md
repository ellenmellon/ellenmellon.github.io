### About Me

I am a second-year CS master student in [UIUC Data Mining Research Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/), supervised by [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). My research interest falls into areas of data mining, machine learning and natural language processing, focusing on *turning massive unstructured text corpora into structured factual knowledge for better exploration and analysis of large corpora*. I am currently working on tasks of information extraction and taxonomy construction from text corpus. Please see my recent publications for details. 

I have co-founded [GrapeTech](https://www.hackx.org/aboutUs), a startup based in Shanghai. We provide a platform [HackX](https://www.hackx.org) for organizing offline and online hackathons across China. Our long term goal is to promote project-based learning ([PBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning)) for technology innovation in China. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at UIUC, with minors in Computer Science, Math and Business. I was very fortunate to have [J. Gary Eden](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jgeden) as my academic (and life) mentor throughout the four years. I have been working on image processing projects in [MRI lab](http://mri.beckman.uiuc.edu/) at UIUC during my sophomore year, supervised by [Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/z-liang).
