1	1	User: Who invented photography? Agent: Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre are the inventors. User: When did color photography arrise? Agent: Do you want to know the time it was first attempted or the foundation method was proposed or the first photograph was made? User: Actually, what is the foundation method?	clarification	The three-color method is the foundation method of practically all color processes including for photography. It is based on the Young-Helmholtz theory that says the human eye is most sensitive to the colors red, green, and blue.	Color photography	The three-color method, which is the foundation of virtually all practical color processes whether chemical or electronic, was first suggested in an 1855 paper on color vision by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.	Color photography	It is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory that the normal human eye sees color because its inner surface is covered with millions of intermingled cone cells of three types: in theory, one type is most sensitive to the end of the spectrum we call "red", another is more sensitive to the middle or "green" region, and a third which is most strongly stimulated by "blue".	Color photography	In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red, green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions.

4		User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	directAnswer	Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction. It can also be released from melting permafrost, releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.	Climate change	Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, excluding those from land use change, were equivalent to 52 billion tonnes of CO2	Climate change	Another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the Earth's surface.

Great Barrier Reef	The dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped 24 kilometres (15 mi) away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4 billion and $2.8 billion.
