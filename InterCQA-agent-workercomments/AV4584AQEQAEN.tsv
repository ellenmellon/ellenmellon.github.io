0		User: Who invented photography? Agent: Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre are the inventors. User: When did color photography arrise? Agent: Do you want to know the time it was first attempted or the foundation method was proposed or the first photograph was made? User: Actually, what is the foundation method?	clarification	Do you want to know the name of the foundation method, what the method entails, or the history of its development?	Color photography	The foundation of all practical color processes, the three-color method was first suggested in an 1855 paper by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, with the first color photograph produced by Thomas Sutton for a Maxwell lecture in 1861.[1][2]	Color photography	It is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory that the normal human eye sees color because its inner surface is covered with millions of intermingled cone cells of three types: in theory, one type is most sensitive to the end of the spectrum we call "red", another is more sensitive to the middle or "green" region, and a third which is most strongly stimulated by "blue".	Color photography	In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red, green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions.[3]		
1		User: Which country does Halloween originate from? Agent: I didn't find specific countries, but Halloween is thought to have roots in Christian beliefs and practices.

3		User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	clarification	Methane can be found in in various types of geologic formations, ecosystems, and living things. Which of those are you interested in receiving more detailed information about?	Methane emissions	About one-third (33%) of anthropogenic emissions are from gas release during the extraction and delivery of fossil fuels; mostly due to gas venting and gas leaks from both active fossil fuel infrastructure and orphan wells.[6]	Methane emissions	The world's wetlands contribute about three-quarters (75%) of the enduring natural sources of methane.[3][4]	Methane emissions	Abiogenic methane is stored in rocks and soil stems from the geologic processes that convert ancient biomass into fossil fuels.[clarification needed][contradictory]		
4	Please select only one paragraph as the evidence for your response. This is because each of them can indicate that WWII contributes to the end of Great Depression. However, if you include different details mentioned exclusively in each paragraph, then you can include all of them as your evidence. It is important to not label redundant or repetitive paragraphs. Let's say your response contains information A and B. You find paragraph 1 containing A, paragraph 2 containing both A and B and paragraph 3 containing C only. In this case, you should ONLY label paragraph 2 as the single evidence paragraph.	User: How did the Great Depression end in the United States?	noAnswerButRelevantInfo	The German invasion of France and America's involvement in World War 2 greatly contributed to the end of the Great Depression in the United States. I could not find an exact event which was responsible for its ending however.

Great Depression in the United States	By the end of 1941, before American entry into the war, defense spending and military mobilization had started one of the greatest booms in American history thus ending the last traces of unemployment.[70]		
5	If you find entity ambiguity in the user request, please simply put the page title as the evidence paragraph. Please see example 4 under the "Example" tab at http://qa.cs.washington.edu:7782/task/qualification/preview#	User: Are there any camping grounds or lodging possibilities in the Glacier National Park?	clarification	Which country's Glacier National Park are you asking about?

Glacier National Park (U.S.)	Glacier National Park is an American national park located in northwestern Montana, on the Canada–United States border, adjacent to the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.				
6	We notice that the two evidence paragraphs do not have breakfast information. It may be more reasonable to label the paragraphs in the "breakfast" section in the same page 	User: How do Ethiopians make Areki? Agent: Areki is a home distilled spirit that is often filtered through charcoal to remove off tastes or flavored by smoking or infusion with garlic. User: What do Ethiopians eat for breakfast?	clarification	There are many vegetarians and vegans in Ethiopia.

8		User: How are nations around the globe combatting climate change? Agent: Are you interested to know specifically about policies being used, international climate agreements, national responses or scientific consensus and society? User: Sorry, but none of them sounds interesting to me.	invalidDialogueContext									
9	Your annotation is reasonable, but it might be better to interpret the user question within the dialogue context, which means the "dumping" may refer to "Great Barrier Reef" specifically.	User: What species are overfished in the Great Barrier Reef? Agent: Giant Triton and sharks are overfished. User: What do people dump in the water?	clarification	Both land based and ocean based items can be intentionally or accidentally dumped in the ocean, which category do you want to know more about?	Marine debris	Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a sea or ocean.	Marine debris	Researchers classify debris as either land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated that up to 80% of the pollution was land-based,[5] with the remaining 20% originating from catastrophic events or maritime sources.[6]				
10		User: Where is the Parinacota located? Agent: Parinacota lies on the western margin of the Altiplano in the Central Andes. In Chile, where most of the edifice is located, Parinacota lies in the commune of Putre, Arica y Parinacota Region, and in Bolivia in the Oruro Department of the Sajama Province. User: How was Parinacota discovered?	noAnswerButRelevantInfo	The area around Parinacota has been inhabited for approximately 7,000-10,000 years. I cannot find any information pertaining to how those original inhabitants discovered it.	Parinacota (volcano)	The region around Parinacota has been inhabited for about 7,000–10,000 years.						
11	I think the ambiguity you pointed out is reasonable. However, if you go to the "Socio-economic effects" section in the same page, you will find out there are a few countried specifically mentioned as less affected than the majority countried. For example, China, Japan, Soviet Union, Spain and so on.	User: Did any specific country have a significantly less severe experience during the Great Depression?	clarification	The Great Depression affected countries all over the world. Which country do you want to use as the point of comparison to judge severity against?	Great Depression	The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States.
