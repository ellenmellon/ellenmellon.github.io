0	The information you find is actually the answer.  Even if you don't think that is the precise answer, as long as you mention it in the response, you should label the paragraph where you find the information as the evidence. We require every piece of information in your response to have grounding in one evidence paragraph labelled in Step 4. Therefore, in this case, the dialogue situation should be "no answer BUT relevant info / partial answer found".	User: Who invented photography?

3	There is no major issue in this annotation. However, a more comprehensive answer can be found.	User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	directAnswer	Methane can be found naturally below the ground and under the seafloor.	Methane	Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor and is formed by both geological and biological processes.						
4	Make sure all information in your response has grounding in an evidence paragraph you entered. In this case, you should enter the evidence for "Banking act of 1935" as well,	User: How did the Great Depression end in the United States?	clarification	There are many reasons that contributed to the Great Depression ending.

5	It should be easy to notice that there is a Glacier National Park in Canada as well. Therefore, you should clarify with the user which park they refer to. Check the 4th example under "Example" tab in this link: http://qa.cs.washington.edu:7782/task/qualification/preview# . Do not bias your answer search based on your own location. 	User: Are there any camping grounds or lodging possibilities in the Glacier National Park?	directAnswer	Yes, there are many campsites along the trails.

7	Again, please do not use informtion that has no grounding in your entered evidence. The paragraph you labeled does not say "epidemic OR pandemic", which indicates these two terms are basically the same. If you want to say this, find an evidence paragraph that supports this claim. In addition, although it is arguable, most other workers label this example as "no answer but relevant info found", as there is no specific info about how WHO define these two terms.	User: How does the WHO decide what constitutes an epidemic and what constitutes a pandemic?	directAnswer	The WHO has a six-stage classification that allows them to determine if an epidemic or pandemic has occurred. These stages assess the probability of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission.	Pandemic	The World Health Organization (WHO) previously applied a six-stage classification to describe the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic.

Great Barrier Reef	Another key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is pollution and declining water quality.	Great Barrier Reef	Pesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.	Great Barrier Reef	Mining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 – on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water.		
10	Being inhabited for 7000-10000 years does not indicate it was discovered 7000-10000 years ago. The discovery time could be way earlier. Therefore, the first sentence in your response should be somthing like "I didn't any the precise answer", and in this case, the dialogue situation should be "no answer but relevant information".
