0		User: Who invented photography? Agent: Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre are the inventors. User: When did color photography arrise? Agent: Do you want to know the time it was first attempted or the foundation method was proposed or the first photograph was made? User: Actually, what is the foundation method?	noAnswerButRelevantInfo	The foundation method of all color processes is actually called the three-color method. It involves taking three colorless photographs of the same scene through red, green and blue filters and then superimposing them on a screen to create a single image.	Color photography	The foundation of all practical color processes, the three-color method was first suggested in an 1855 paper by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, with the first color photograph produced by Thomas Sutton for a Maxwell lecture in 1861.	Color photography	In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red, green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions.				
1	"Great Britain" doesn't seem to have any information in your annotated 2 evidence paragraphs. In this case, you should only mention  Ireland and North America. Another option is to enter a single paragraph with the first sentence as "List of foods associated with Halloween:", which contains all three regions.

User: What are some types of food eaten during Halloween?	clarification	The food eaten during Halloween varies depending on where in the world you are. Do you want food eaten in Ireland, Great Britain, North America, or more general foods?

Halloween	One custom that persists in modern-day Ireland is the baking (or more often nowadays, the purchase) of a barmbrack (Irish: báirín breac), which is a light fruitcake, into which a plain ring, a coin, and other charms are placed before baking.	Halloween	List of foods associated with Halloween:	Halloween	On All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage abstinence from meat, giving rise to a variety of vegetarian foods associated with this day.
2	This is our fault in not making it clear in the intruction. If you could, it is strongly suggested to label your last evidence paragraph from the actual "Lancashire hotpot" page, instead of the "Hot pot (disambiguation)"	User: What kind of food goes in hotpots?	clarification	A hotpot contains different foods in different cultures. Are you interested in a hotpot in Korea, Karelia, China, Britain, or somewhere else?

3	It seems like your response only used information from your annotated paragraph 1, 3 and 4. Therefore, you don't need to annotate 2 as it is redundant.	User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	clarification	Methane is primarily found below ground and under the seafloor, where it is often in the form of methane clathrates, but also occurs in the atmosphere and on all planets in our Solar System.	Methane	Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor and is formed by both geological and biological processes.	Methane	Methane was discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from Lake Maggiore.	Methane	Atmospheric methane	Methane	Methane is abundant in many parts of the Solar System and potentially could be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body (in particular, using methane production from local materials found on Mars[65] or Titan), providing fuel for a return journey.
4		User: How did the Great Depression end in the United States?	directAnswer	Many measures were tried to improve the effects of the Great Depression throughout the 1930s, including Roosevelt's New Deal, but ultimately the American entry into WWII is what caused the American economy to skyrocket and the Great Depression to end.

7	Similar to above comments, your first entered paragraph is not used in your response. You should either remove it or add information from it to your response.	User: How does the WHO decide what constitutes an epidemic and what constitutes a pandemic?	noAnswerButRelevantInfo	At one point the WHO had a six-stage classification process to classify the stages of a pandemic, but they now say "there is no official category [for a pandemic]".	Pandemic	A pandemic is an epidemic occurring on a scale that crosses international boundaries, usually affecting people on a worldwide scale.

9	Similar to above comments, your third entered paragraph is not used in your response. You should either remove it or add information from it to your response. The dumping of water waste seems to be something happened in the past. It would be better to reflect it in your response.	User: What species are overfished in the Great Barrier Reef? Agent: Giant Triton and sharks are overfished. User: What do people dump in the water?	directAnswer	Many harmful substances are dumped in the Great Barrier Reef, including dredging sludge and mining waste water.	Great Barrier Reef	A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism.	Great Barrier Reef	Mining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 – on the later occasion releasing 516 tonnes (508 long tons; 569 short tons) of waste water.	Great Barrier Reef	In December 2013, Greg Hunt, the Australian environment minister, approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3 million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.		
10		User: Where is the Parinacota located? Agent: Parinacota lies on the western margin of the Altiplano in the Central Andes.

User: Did any specific country have a significantly less severe experience during the Great Depression?	clarification	There were many countries less affected by the Great Depression, primarily those with fewer international dependencies. Is there a particular region of the world you'd like to know more about?	Great Depression	China was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the Silver standard.
