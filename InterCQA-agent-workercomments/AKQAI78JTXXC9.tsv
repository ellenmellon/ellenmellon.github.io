Agent: Do you want to know the time it was first attempted or the foundation method was proposed or the first photograph was made? User: Actually, what is the foundation method?	directAnswer	The foundation method is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory about how the human eye sees color.  James Clerk Maxwell, in his studies on human vision, showed that any visible hue or gray tone could be make be mixing red, green, and blue together to stimulate the cells in the eyes into seeing the desired color.	Color photography	It is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory that the normal human eye sees color because its inner surface is covered with millions of intermingled cone cells of three types: in theory, one type is most sensitive to the end of the spectrum we call "red", another is more sensitive to the middle or "green" region, and a third which is most strongly stimulated by "blue".	Color photography	In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red, green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions.
