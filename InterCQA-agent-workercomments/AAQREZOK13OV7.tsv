Section outlines in Wikipedia pages can be useful in locating answers.	User: Did any specific country have a significantly less severe experience during the Great Depression?	directAnswer	China was not affected as much due to being on the silver standard instead of the gold standard.	Great Depression	China was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the Silver standard. However, the U.S. silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so, in the end, the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks'[which?] "legal note" issues. China and the British colony of Hong Kong, which followed suit in this regard in September 1935, would be the last to abandon the silver standard.
