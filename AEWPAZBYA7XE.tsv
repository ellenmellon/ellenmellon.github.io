4	1 and / or 4 (maybe you think "greenhouse gases" indicates "climate change" in your response, but it's not clear in your evidence paragraphs. Also, try to list out clarification options in a more concrete way, and re-use terms in your labeled paragraphs if you can.)	User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	clarification	Are you wanting to know where methane resides as it relates to climate change, or where methane emanates from?	Atmospheric methane	Atmospheric methane is the methane present in Earth's atmosphere.	Atmospheric methane	The balance between sources and sinks of methane is not yet fully understood. The IPCC Working Group I stated in chapter 2 of the Fourth Assessment Report that there are "large uncertainties in the current bottom-up estimates of components of the global source", and the balance between sources and sinks is not yet well known. The most important sink in the methane cycle is reaction with the hydroxyl radical, which is produced photochemically in the atmosphere.	Atmospheric methane	Any process that results in the production of methane and its release into the atmosphere can be considered a "source". Two main processes that are responsible for methane production include microorganisms anaerobically converting organic compounds into methane (methanogenesis), which are widespread in aquatic ecosystems, and ruminant animals.	Methane	The two main routes for geological methane generation are (i) organic (thermally generated, or thermogenic) and (ii) inorganic (abiotic).
