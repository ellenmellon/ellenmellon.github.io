Agent: Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce, Henry Fox Talbot and Louis Daguerre are the inventors. User: When did color photography arrise? Agent: Do you want to know the time it was first attempted or the foundation method was proposed or the first photograph was made? User: Actually, what is the foundation method?	directAnswer	Would you like to know when the first photograph was made using this method?	Color photography	The three-color method, which is the foundation of virtually all practical color processes whether chemical or electronic, was first suggested in an 1855 paper on color vision by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.						
2	1 and 4 (if you find different types of food, you should find evidence for each of them and either list out them as concrete options for the user in a clarification question, or directly summarize into a 1-2 sentence answer. Also, you don't need 3 paragraphs as evidence for "Halloween cake".)	User: Which country does Halloween originate from? Agent: I didn't find specific countries, but Halloween is thought to have roots in Christian beliefs and practices.

3	1 and 4 (if you find different varieties, you should find evidence for each of them and list out them as concrete options for the user.

4	1 (the third paragraph is redundant)	User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	directAnswer	Some emissions are produced naturally, but most that contribute to greenhouse gases come from fossil fuel use, animal agriculture, plant agriculture, and waste.	Methane emissions	About one-third (33%) of anthropogenic emissions are from gas release during the extraction and delivery of fossil fuels; mostly due to gas venting and gas leaks from both active fossil fuel infrastructure and orphan wells.	Methane emissions	The world's wetlands contribute about three-quarters (75%) of the enduring natural sources of methane.	Methane emissions	Abiogenic methane is stored in rocks and soil stems from the geologic processes that convert ancient biomass into fossil fuels.		
5	1 or 4? (If possible, try to use concrete options that clearly corresponds to each evidence paragraph and consider re-use terms in those paragraphs.

8	13 and 14 (The information provided in your response does not directly answer the user request. Therefore, it can only be considered relevant information. In this case, do not ask a suggestive question and instead, just directly provide the highly relevant information. If there are too many relevant information, try to provide the most relevant one. If you insist that the relevant info or the partial answer is too long and requires a clarification, you should still label the dialogue situation as "no answer but relevant info / partial answer found" => see FAQ in the instruction)	User: How does the WHO decide what constitutes an epidemic and what constitutes a pandemic?	clarification	An epidemic is the rapid spread of a disease to many hosts in a short period of time whereas a pandemic is an epidemic that crosses international boundaries.

User: Sorry, but none of them sounds interesting to me.	invalidDialogueContext									
10	1 or 4? (I guess the issue here is that it is not straightforward each option you provide in your clarification question maps to which evidence paragraph. If possible, try to use concrete options that clearly corresponds to each evidence paragraph and consider re-use terms in those paragraphs. A big part of our project is to collect "factually grounded" dialogue responses. Therefore, it si very important that your response has clear connection to labeled evidence.)

User: What do people dump in the water?	clarification	Are you asking what people are dumping in the water from a pollution aspect or what people are using for bait that results in the area being overfished?	Environmental issues with coral reefs	Reefs in close proximity to human populations are subject to poor water quality from land- and marine-based sources.	Environmental threats to the Great Barrier Reef	The new Ports Bill fails to rule out any currently proposed new dredging, the dumping of dredge spoil in the Reef's waters and is silent on maintenance dredging across the region.

In addition, you should not ask a suggestive question and should directly provide any relevant info.)	User: Where is the Parinacota located? Agent: Parinacota lies on the western margin of the Altiplano in the Central Andes. In Chile, where most of the edifice is located, Parinacota lies in the commune of Putre, Arica y Parinacota Region, and in Bolivia in the Oruro Department of the Sajama Province.
