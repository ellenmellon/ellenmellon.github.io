4	1	User: What is the main cause of contemporary climate change? Agent: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Are you looking for the sources of such greenhouse gases? User: I'm curious to know where methane can be found?	clarification	Would you like to know where methane naturally occurs, or would you like to know where methane occurs as the byproduct of a process?	Methane clathrate	Methane clathrates are restricted to the shallow lithosphere (i.e. < 2,000 m depth). Furthermore, necessary conditions are found only in either continental sedimentary rocks in polar regions where average surface temperatures are less than 0 °C; or in oceanic sediment at water depths greater than 300 m where the bottom water temperature is around 2 °C.	Methane clathrate	In the less common second type found near the sediment surface, some samples have a higher proportion of longer-chain hydrocarbons (< 99% methane) contained in a structure II clathrate.	Sewer gas	Sewer gases may include hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, esters, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.	Natural gas	Natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates.
5	1	User: How did the Great Depression end in the United States?	directAnswer	The answer is complicated, but the general consensus is that the Great Depression ended in the United States with the start of World War II due to government spending and job creation for the war effort.

10	maybe 1 or maybe 4	User: What species are overfished in the Great Barrier Reef? Agent: Giant Triton and sharks are overfished. User: What do people dump in the water?	clarification	This is a broad question that has many possible answers. Would you like to know about man made pollution that makes it way to the oceans?

Great Depression	France's relatively high degree of self-sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in neighbouring states like Germany.	Great Depression	By the 1930s, Sweden had what America's Life magazine called in 1938 the "world's highest standard of living". Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression.

Mistake code	Mistake description											
1	A rule of thumb when labeling evidence paragraphs and writing your response - Every evidence paragraph needs to have some information that is used in your response, and every piece of information in your response needs to have grounding in an evidence paragraph (you can double check this by doing a fact checking on your own response based on your entered evidence paragraphs). In addition, DO NOT label multiple paragraphs that support the same information piece in your response. Let's say your response contains information A and B. You find that paragraph 1 contains A, paragraph 2 contains both A and B and paragraph 3 contains C only. In this case, you should only label paragraph 2 as the single evidence paragraph. 											
2	There are more answers in the same Wikipedia page you find (e.g., different varieties and so on)											
3	The answer can be easily found											
4	When raising a clarification question to the user, make sure you list out concrete options / conditions you find in evidence paragraphs for the user to choose. For example, if you find different answers depending on whether the location is "Canada" or "Ireland". Ask "Do you want to know about Canada or Ireland?" instead of “Which country do you mean?”.											
5	An entity in the user request is ambiguous. Check example 4 under "Example" tab in the instruction.
